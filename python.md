# Numerical Calculations

The following operations apply to numbers or variables (e.g., `a`, `b`) that have been assigned a number.

```
a+b 	addition
a−b 	subtraction
a*b 	multiplication
a/b 	division
a//b    floor division
a%b 	modulo
−a      negation
abs(a)  absolute value
a**b    exponent (not a^b!)
```

There are many other [math functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) that can be used. To use these functions, you need to `import` them, e.g.,

```Python
import math     # Import the math module
math.log10(100) # 2.0
```

The meaning of `import` will be covered later. For now, think of it as a way of telling Python to add new capabilities.

# Variable Assignment

In programs, one often assigns values to variables.

```Python
a = 2
b = 3
c = a*b 
```

Technically, `a=2` means

> The value of 2 is assigned to the variable named `a`

or

> The variable named `a` was set to 2

and **not**

> `a` equals 2

To see why "`a` equals 2" is not correct, consider

```Python
a = 1
a = a + 1
```

If one uses algebra on the last line, you will conclude `0 = 1`!

# Data Types

In Python, variables are assigned the values of other variables or the result of calculations involving other variables and values.

```Python
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + 33
```

The numeric data types in Python are `int`, `float`, `long`, and `complex`. The type of a value or variable determines:

1. how the value is stored internally as a bit pattern and
2. the limits on the values a variable may take.

Python is unusual in that for most programming languages, the `int` type has a limit of values that can be represented (e.g., `-2147483648` to `2147483647`). In Python, there is no limit, so one can compute  `2147483647*2147483647` and get an answer. In most languages, this statement would generate an error message.

The limits on `float` values are
* max/min: `+/- 1.7976931348623157e+308`
* nearest zero: `+/- 2.2250738585072014e-308`
* [epsilon](http://nm.mathforcollege.com/blog/machine_epsilon.pdf) (smallest number such that 1+epsilon > 1): `2.2204460492503131e-16 `

(The above information can be obtained using the commands `import sys; sys.float_info`.)

To test the limits, consider

```Python
2*1.7976931348623157e+308   # inf
1.0 + 2.220446049250313e-16 # 1.0000000000000002
1.0 + 2.220446049250313e-17 # 1.0
```

# Functions

A **function** in Python is similar to a function in mathematics. In general, it takes inputs and returns an output.

In the following the input is a list and the output is a numeric data type (int, float, etc.) 

```Python
s = sum([1, 2]) # One input. Gives s = 3
s = sum([1, 2], 10) # Two inputs. Gives s = 13. See help(sum).
```

# Methods

A **method** is an operation that applies to a certain data structure. It has similarities to **functions**, but the syntax is slightly different:

```Python
L = [1, 2]
L.append(99) # Append the value 99 to list L.
print(L) # [1, 2, 99]
```
The inputs to the operation of `append` are the list `L` and the number `99`. In the above example, the output of the operation of `L.append(99)` is ignored (because it is not assigned to a variable). The output of the operation can be thought of the modified version of `L`.

The output of a method operation can be assigned to a variable, but often it is not useful

```Python
L = [1,2]
x = L.append(99) # Append the value 99 to list L.
print(L) [1, 2, 99]
print(type(x)) # NoneType
```

# Modules

A **module** is a collection of **functions**. In an advanced command line interface such as IPython or Spyder, _tab completion_ can be used to list all of the functions available in a module (e.g., by entering `math.` and then pressing the `TAB` key.).

There are two ways to import the functions in the module. The standard method is to use `import MODULENAME` as in

```Python
# Recommended method 1.
import math # Import the math module
print(math.log10(100)) # 2.0
```

One advantage of this approach is that you know which module a function being used is from, which makes looking up documentation easier. One disadvantage is that the name of basic function must be preceded by the name of the module, which make the code longer.

To avoid having to prefix functions in the math module by `math`, one can import the functions that will be used using `from math import` as in

```Python
# Recommended method 2.
from math import log10 # Import the log10 function
from math import sin   # Import the sin function
print(log10(100)) # 2.0
print(sin(0)) # 0.0
```

All of the functions and attributes of a module can be imported using `*`:

```Python
# Not recommended
from math import *
print(log10(100)) # 2.0
print(sin(0)) # 0.0
```

The disadvantage of this approach is that you may have defined a variable with the same name as an attribute or function in the `math` module. This is called a __name collision__ or __name conflict__. The problem with the following program is that a reader may see the first import statement, scan down to the last line and expect `print(e)` to display `2.718281828459045` because they did not see that `e` was redefined. For example

```Python
# Not recommended; example of where import * can
# create confusion.
from math import *
# Print the value of e from the math module
print(e) # 2.718281828459045

# ... many lines of code later

# User-defined variable replaces math module's e
e = 37.1

# ... many lines of code later
print(e) # 37.1
```

Sometimes you will see the name used to access functions in a module changed using the import statement. In the following, the import statement indicates that functions and attributes of the math module are accessed by prefixing a function name using `m` instead of `math`.

```Python
import math as m # Not recommended b/c few people do this
print(m.log10(100)) # 2
```

The choice of a shorter name is dictated by convention that is given in the examples of the documentation for a module. For example, the following are common conventions for importing two popular modules

```Python
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np
```

# Objects

Thus far, I have used the term **variable**, e.g.,

```Python
# Assign value 1 to variable named a. 
# a will have an integer data type.
a = 1 
```
In many programming languages,  **variable** is the correct term, but in Python technically what we commonly refer to as variables are **objects**.

```Python
a = 1 # a is an object of class 'int'
print(type(a)) # <class 'int'>
```

Every type of object in Python has associated **attributes** and **methods**  (covered previously). In Spyder and IPython, the attributes and methods can be seen by entering a variable name followed by a dot and then pressing the tab key (referred to as "tab completion").

```Python
a = 1.1 
# Enter a. and then the TAB key and to see a.as_integer_ratio, a.is_integer, etc.
```
A quick way of determining the attributes and  methods associated with an object is to use tab completion and then experiment:

```Python
a = 0.75
print(a.as_integer_ratio()) # (3, 4)
print(a.is_integer()) # False
```
To find documentation for a method that can be used on an object, use `help(objname)`, e.g.,

```Python
help(a.is_integer)
```

A Python list object has several methods, one of which is `reverse`.

```Python
b = [9, 10] # b is a list object
b.reverse() # reverse is a method that reverses the order of elements in a list
print(b) # [10, 9]
```

# Attributes

Some objects and modules have associated attributes. These are usually constants or quantities that are pre-calculated.

```Python
import math    # Import math module
print(math.pi) # 3.141592653589793
print(math.e)  # 2.718281828459045

```

A key difference in notation between an attribute and a method is a method does not take arguments.

```Python
import math        # Import math module
print(math.pi)     # Correct usage
print(math.pi())   # Error b/c pi is an attribute and not a method
print(math.pi(10)) # Error b/c pi is an attribute and not a method
```

In NumPy, the primary data object is called an `ndarray`, which has attributes that indicate its shape and size.

```Python
import numpy as np

# Create 2x3 ndarray
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[1, 1, 1]]) 
print(A)
# [[1 2 3]
#  [1 1 1]]

# Use size attribute to find number of elements in A
print(A.size) # 6

# Use shape attribute to find number of rows and columns in A
print(A.shape) # (2, 3)

# Use flatten method to create a 1-D ndarray
B = A.flatten()
print(B) # [1 2 3 1 1 1]
print(B.size)  # 6
print(B.shape) # (6,)
```

# The print and format functions

There are several functions that can be used to print output in Python. The most commonly used is `print`. For basic use, its syntax is easy.

There are several unfortunate complications:

1. Some `print` statements that worked in Python 2 won't work in Python 3
2. The recommended way to use the `print` statement changed from Python 2 to 3

This is unfortunate because `print` is one of the most commonly used functions introduced to Python beginners.

You'll see this in many older programs

```Python
print "hello" # Error in Python 3; recommended syntax in Python 2
```

In Python 3, the syntax is 

```Python
print("hello") # Works in Python 2 and 3; recommended syntax in Python 3
```

## Print

If `var1`, `var2`, ... are strings or numeric data types (int, float, etc.), then `print(var1, var2, var3, var4, ...)` displays them on a single line and separated by spaces. For example,

```Python
print("Greetings", 1, 13.1, "wow") # Greetings 1 13.1 wow
```

**See also**: [Hello, World in Python]( https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3/Hello,_World)

## Format

To format the output of `print`, one needs to apply the method `format` to a string

The statement

```Python
a = 8
b = 9
s = "{0} {1}".format(a, b)
print(s) # '8 9'
```

replaces `{0}` with the first argument to `format` (the `a`) and `{1}` with the second argument to `format` (the `b`). The curly braces indicate something to be substituted and an integer in the braces indicate which argument to the `format` function is to be substituted. 

In contrast to the `append`method described in [Methods](#Methods), which returns a value that is usally ignored, the `format` method returns the formatted string.

In the following, the value of `b` is shown twice followed by the value of `a` twice.

```Python
a = 8
b = 9
s = "{1} {1} {0} {0}".format(a, b)
print(s) # '9 9 8 8'
```

Often one wants control over how numeric values are displayed. For example, suppose that you only want to display floating point numbers to two decimal places. By default, 16 decimal places are displayed: 

```Python
print("Result =", 1/3)
# Result = 0.3333333333333333
```

To control how many decimals are shown, use a colon followed by a format specifier after the first number in curly braces:

```Python
a = 1/3
print("Result = {0:.2f}".format(a))
# Result = 0.33
# is displayed
```

The `{0:.2f}` is a template that tells Python which number to display and how to display it. `{0:.2f}` translates to

> Print the 0th argument passed to `format` (the variable `a`) as a floating point (the `f` indicates this) number with two decimal places (the `.2` indicates this).

```Python
a = 1/3
b = 1/4
print("a = {0:.2f} b = {1:.3f}".format(a, b))
# a = 0.33 b = 0.250
```

The code `{1:.3f}` translates to 

> Print the 1st argument (`b`) passed to `format` as a floating point number with three decimal places.

The `f` is a format code. Another common format code is `e`, which is used to display a number in exponential format:

```Python
a = 1000*1/3
print("Result = {0:.2e}".format(a))
# Result = 3.33e+02
print("Result = {0:.5e}".format(a))
# Result = 3.33333e+02
```

# `if` statement

## Basic Form

The most basic form of the `if` statement is

```Python
if test:
	statement 1
	statement 2
```

Which reads "If `test` is true, evaluate the indented statements". For example,

```Python
if 2 > 1:
  print("test is true")
```

`test` can also be a variable:

```Python
a = 2 > 1 # a takes on the value True
if a:
  print("a is True")
```

Thus far, variables that are strings, numeric, or lists have only been used. In Python, a variable can also be assigned a value of `True` or `False` either directly or indirectly.

```Python
a = True  # Assign directly
b = 2 < 1 # Assigns value of False indirectly
```

| Test      | Meaning                           |
| ----------| --------------------------------- |
| x < y     | is x less than y?                 |
| x > y     | is x greater than y?              |
| x == y    | is x equal to y?                  |
| x <= y    | is x less than or equal to y?     |
| x >= y    | is x greater than or equal to y?  |
| x != y    | is x not equal to y?              |


## General Form

A more general form is

```Python
if test:
	statement T1
	statement T2
	...
else:
	statement F1
	statement F2
	...
```

Which reads "If `test` is true, evaluate the indented statements immediately following; otherwise, evaluate the indented statements following `else`". For example,

```Python
if 2 > 1:
  print("2 is greater than 1")
else:
  print("2 is not greater than 1")
```

Results in `2 is greater than 1` being displayed and

```Python
if 2 < 1:
  print("2 is less than 1")
else:
  print("2 is not less than 1")
```

Results in `2 is not less than 1` being displayed.

The most general form is

```Python
if testA:
  # Evaluated if testA is True
elif testB:
  # Evaluated if testA is False and TestB is true
elif testC:
  # Evaluated if testA and testB are both False and TestC is true
...
else:
  # Evaluated if none of the tests were true
```

The statements associated with the `else` are called "fall-through" statements.

For example, when the following is executed

```Python
a = 3
if a > 5:
  print('A commands')
elif a > 4:
  print('B commands')
elif a > 3:
  print('C commands')
else:
  print('D commands')
```

`D commands` is displayed. If the value of `a` on the first line is changed to 4, then `C commands` is displayed.

## Compound Tests

The test in an `if` statement can be a logical statement involving several test conditions, for example,

```Python
if (2 > 1) and (3 > 1):
  print("Both test conditions true")
```

```Python
if (2 > 1) or (3 > 1):
  print("At least one test condition true")
```

Parenthesis can be used to group multiple tests:

```Python
if (2 > 1 and 3 > 1) or (10 == 11):
  print("Compound condition is True")
```

As before, the result of a logical test can be assigned to a variable:

```Python
a = (2 > 1 and 3 > 1) or (10 == 11)
if a:
  print("Compound condition is True")
```

Sometimes it is clearer to break the compound test into parts:

```Python
a = 2 > 1 and 3 > 1
b = 10 == 11
if a or b:
  print("Compound condition is True")
```

# Lists

## Overview

A fundamental data structure (a structure that hold data) in Python is the **list**. A list can store heterogenous elements (elements with different data types).

The syntax is

```Python
a = [1, 2, 5]         # Stores all ints
b = [1, 'hello', 2.2] # Stores an int, str, and float
```

Adding a space after a comma is a common convention in Python programs. It is not needed, but you should get in the habit of using this convention. People and code "linters" (grammar and spell checkers for code) will complain otherwise.

To determine how many elements are in a list, use the `len()` function, which returns an integer, e.g.,

```Python
len(a) # 3
```

A related data structure is the **tuple**. Think of it as a list that can't be changed. Instead being specified with square braces, e.g., `a = [1, 2, 3]`, it is specified with parentheses, e.g., `a = (1, 2, 3)`. 

## Accessing and Modifying List Elements

### Accessing a Single Element 

To access a single element in a list, use the notation `listvar[i]`, where `listvar` is the name of a list variable and `i` is an integer.

Python indices are **zero-based** - the first element's address is `0`.

```Python
a = [0, 11, 22]
a[0] # 0 (1st element in a)
a[1] # 11 (2nd element in a)
a[2] # 22 (3rd element in a)
a[3] # Error
len(a) # 3
a[len(a)-1] # 22 (same as a[2])
```

Python allows **index-wrapping** (negative indexing) - The last element has an index of `-1`.  Larger negative numbers correspond to elements near the start of the array.

```Python
a = [0, 11, 22]
# Python's view of a
#    [   0    11,    22,    0,    11,  22]
#    a[-3]  a[-2]  a[-1]  a[0]   a[1]  a[2]
```

```Python
a = [0, 11, 22]
a[len(a)-1] # 22 (last element in a)
a[-1]       # 22 (more compactly reference to last element)

a[len(a)-2] # 11 (second-to-last element in a)
a[-2]       # 11 (more compactly reference to sencond-to-last element)

a[len(a)-4] # Error
a[-4]       # Error
```

###  Modifying a Single Element

A list element can be modified in the way that you would expect.

```Python
a = [0, 11, 22]
a[0] = 99 # a is now [99, 11, 22]
a[1] = 88 # a is now [99, 88, 22]
a[5] = 1  # Error b/c a does not have a 6th element.
```

In contrast, if `a` was defined as a tuple, an error would result when we tried to modified one of its elements:

```Python
a = (0, 11, 22)
a[0] = 99 # Error
```

###  Accessing Multiple Contiguous Elements (slicing)

To access multiple elements in a list, the **colon** notation can be used. In Python, use of the colon operator on a list is referred to as "slicing a list". 

The main way of extracting a slice from an array is with the syntax

```Python
listvar[start:stop] # start is inclusive; stop is inclusive!
```

This returns elements `start`, `start + 1`, ..., `stop - 1`.

```Python
a = [0, 11, 22, 33, 44] # Create a list
b = a[0:3]              # b contains a[0], a[1], a[2]: b = [0, 11, 22]
b = a[3:5]              # b = [33, 44]
b = a[3:len(a)]         # b = [33, 44]
b = a[1:1]              # same as b = a[1]
```

###  Modifying Multiply Contiguous Elements

There is not a simple syntax for doing an operation using native Python. That is, setting 

```Python
# Does not work
a = [0, 11, 22, 33, 44]
a[0:2] = -99 # Set first and second elements to -99
```
The NumPy library allows these types of operations.

###  Accessing Multiple Non-Contiguous Elements

A list can be subsetted with gaps between selected elements using the syntax

```Python
# Extract every step element from start through stop-1
listvar[start:stop:step] 
```

```Python
a = [0, 11, 22, 33, 44]
b = a[0:5:2] # b = [0, 22, 44]
b = a[1:5:1] # same as b = a[1:5]
```

If `step` is negative, slicing is done in reverse, e.g.,

```Python
a = [0, 11, 22, 33]
b = a[0:4,-1] # b = [33, 22, 11, 0]
b = a[0:4,-2] # b = [33, 11]
```

###  Syntactic Sugar for Accessing Elements

Syntactic sugar is a term used for shorthand notation for common operations. Like sugar, use sparingly (code that is too terse and clever can be difficult to read).

```Python
listvar[:stop:step]  # No start given; start = 0 assumed
listvar[start::step] # No stop given; stop = len(listvar) assumed
listvar[::step]      # start = 0, stop = len(listvar) assumed
```

```Python
a = [11, 12, 13, 14]
a[:2:1] # [11, 12]
a[2::1] # [13, 14]
a[::2]  # [11, 13]
```

## Copy by Value vs. Copy by Reference

When a new list variable is defined based on an existing list, changes to the existing list variable will result in changes to the new list. For example,

```Python
a = [0, 11, 22, 33, 44]
b = a       # b is a copy-by-reference of a
b[0] = 88
print(b[0]) # b[0] is 88, as expected
a[0] = 99
print(b[0]) # b[0] is 99!
```

Internally, Python stored `b` as a statement "b is the same as a". For very large arrays, this can save memory. For example, if `a` has 10,000 elements and `b=a`, then internally Python only needs to allocate memory for the statement "b is the same as a" instead of actually storing 10,000 new values in memory.

If you don't want this a variable to be copied by reference, one can use the notation `b = a.copy()` or more compactly, `b = a[:]` to copy by value:

```Python
a = [0, 11, 22, 33, 44]
b = a.copy() # b is a copy-by-value of a
b[0] = 88
print(b[0])  # b[0] is 88
a[0] = 99
print(b[0])  # b[0] is 88
```

## List Methods

###  `append`

`listvar.append(val)` appends `val` to the array.

```Python
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.append(99)
print(a) # [1, 2, 3, 99]
```

A common error is to use

```Python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a.append(99) 
print(b) # None
print(a) # [1, 2, 3, 99]
```

and expect `b = [1, 2, 3, 99]`. 

`append` can be used to create multi-dimensional lists

```Python
a = []             # Create an empty list
a.append([11, 22]) # a = [[11, 22]]
a.append([33, 44]) # a = [[11, 22], [33, 44]]
a[0][0] # 11
a[0][1] # 22
a[1][0] # 33
a[1][1] # 44
```

### `insert`

`listvar.insert(i, val)` inserts value `val` before element `i` in `listvar`.

```Python
a = [0, 11, 22, 33]
a.insert(1,55) # a = [0, 55, 11, 22, 33]
```

Caution: if the value of `i` is larger than `len(listvar)`, Python assumes you meant `i = len(listvar)`. This can lead to code that runs without error that produces unexpected results.

In the following, 

```Python
a = [0, 11, 22, 33]
a.insert(99, -7) # a = [0, 11, 22, 33, -7]
```

`a.insert(99,3)` means insert `-7` before the 99th element in `a`. This does not sound sensical because `a` has only four elements, but Python allows it.

### `reverse`

`listvar.reverse()` reverses the elements in `listvar`

```Python
a = [0, 11, 22, 33]
a.reverse() # a = [33, 22, 11 ,0]
```

###  ```index```

###  ```count```

### ```sort```

### ```reverse```

###  ```copy```

# Iteration 

## Motivation

Almost all simulation of physical models requires repeating calculations. 

In computing, '''iteration''' means "repeat calculation".  Simulating a model of a physical system usually requires '''iteration'''.

For example, suppose the population of the number of rabbits on an island doubles every year and the population was initially `10` rabbits.  The population in year `2` could be computed by entering

```Python
P = 10   # Assign to a variable named P the value 10.
P = 2*P  # Assign to a variable named P the previous value of P times 2.
```

To compute the population in year 5, the following could be entered
```Python
P = 10   # Year 1
P = 2*P  # Year 2
P = 2*P  # Year 3
P = 2*P  # Year 4
P = 2*P  # Year 5
```

The command `P = 2*P` has been repeated four times.  Recall that Python ignores everything after and including the `#`

Suppose that you want to compute the population in year `1000` and don't want to type all the commands required to do the computation.  There are several types of short-hand syntax for '''iteration'''.  The most commonly used is the `for` loop syntax.  (In programming, the word "loop" means repeat).  The `while` loop can also be used for '''iteration'''.  The key task in programming with '''iteration''' is finding the parts of the program that can be repeated and re-written using short-hand syntax.

## For Loop Basic Pattern

A `for` loop is short-hand syntax that allows you to re-write a set of statements as something that (usually) requires fewer lines.

{| border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%" align="left"
|-
|style="vertical-align:top" width="220px" |
Long-hand pattern:
```Python
P = 2*P
P = 2*P
P = 2*P
P = 2*P
``` 
|style="vertical-align:top"|
Short-hand using `for loop`:
```Python
for i in [0,1,2,3]: # Line A.
  P = 2*P           # Line B.
``` 
|}

The lines in this statement are interpreted as:
* Line A: Set an '''index variable''' `i` to the first value in the array `[0,1,2,3]`. Note that an index variable does not always have to be `i`. As long as it is a valid variable, it can be used as an index variable. For example, `m, n, b1, J, etc.` would all be valid names for an index variable. 
* Line B: Do the computation `P = 2*P`. If all of the possible values of `i` in the list `[0,1,2,3]` have been used, continue to the next unindented line.  Otherwise, repeat line B. again with the next value of `i` in the list (which is `1`).

In this example, there was only one indented line after the `for` line. This is not required.  Later, there will be multiple indented lines.

## For Loop Basic Pattern

This is an example of replacing a basic pattern with a `for` loop. Note that the first line does not fit the pattern and cannot be shortened.

{| border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%" align="left"
|-
|style="vertical-align:top" width="220px" |
Original program:
```Python
P = 10
P = 2*P
P = 2*P
P = 2*P
P = 2*P
```
|style="vertical-align:top"|
Shorthand using `for loop`:
```Python
P = 10
for i in [1,2,3,4]:
  P = 2*P
```
|}

What will happen if you replace `i in [0,1,2,3]` with `i in [7,8,9,10]` or `i in [1,3,5,7]`?

In this case, you will get the same result. The indented part (the '''body''' of the `for` loop) after the `for` line is repeated as many times as there are numbers in the list associated with `i`.  Because the body of the `for` loop does not reference the index variable `i`, it does not matter what for numbers are in the square brackets, only that there are four numbers.

As we will see, if the body of the `for` loop includes a reference to `i`, the result will depend on the list associated with the index variable.

## Syntax Rules

* The code after the `for` line that is to be iterated must be indented.
* The `for` statement must be lower case.
* The line that starts with `for` must end with a semicolon. The most common syntax error is due to the missing semicolon.

## Basic Pattern Example I

{| border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%" align="left"
|-
|style="vertical-align:top"  width="33%" |
Original program:
```Python
x = 10
x = x + 1
x = x + 1
x = x + 1
x = x + 1
x = x + 13
```
|style="vertical-align:top"  width="33%" |
The middle `x=x+1` statements are repeated four times, so they can be re-written using a `for` loop:
```Python
x = 10
for i in [0,1,2,3]:
  x = x+1
x = x + 13
```
|style="vertical-align:top"  width="33%" |
This will give the same result:
```Python
x = 10
for i in [1,5,10,20]:
 x = x+1
end
x = x + 13
```
|}

## Basic Pattern Example II

{| border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%" align="left"
|-
|style="vertical-align:top" width="33%" |
Original program:
```Python
a = 0
z = a+1
a = z+1
z = a+1
a = z+1
```
|style="vertical-align:top"  width="30%" |
In this case, there are pairs of repeated lines, so there are two lines in the body of the `for` loop: 
```Python
a = 0
for i in [1,2]:
  z = a+1
  a = z+1
```
|style="vertical-align:top "  width="33%" |
A change in values of list associated with the index variable will give the same result:
```Python
a = 0
for i in [99,101]:
  z = a+1
  a = z+1
```
|}

## For Loop General Pattern

Thus far, we have used the number of values between the square brackets as an indicator of how many times the repeated part should be repeated.  What is actually happening when we enter

```Python
for i in [1,2]
  P = 2*P
end
```

is that Python is executing the commands

```Python
 i = 1
 P = 2*P
 i = 2
 P = 2*P
```

That is, prior to executing the commands in the body of the `for` loop, Python is assigning a value to the '''index variable'''. 

## General Pattern Example I

The set of commands on the left are equivalent to the set of commands on the right.
{| border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%" align="left"
|-
|style="vertical-align:top" width="50%"|
```Python
for i in [1,2,3,4]:
  a = i*i
```
|style="vertical-align:top"|
```Python
i = 1
a = i*i
i = 2
a = i*i
i = 3
a = i*i
i = 4
a = i*i
```
|}

The set of commands on the left are equivalent to the set of commands on the right. Note that because the index variable `i` appears in the body of the `for` loop, their actual values matter; a different set of four numbers in the list associated with `i` will give differents values for `a`.
{| border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%" align="left"
|-
|style="vertical-align:top" width="50%"|
```Python
for i in [10,11,12,14]:
  a = i*i
```
|style="vertical-align:top"|
```Python
i = 10
a = i*i
i = 11
a = i*i
i = 12
a = i*i
i = 14
a = i*i
```
|}

## General Pattern Example II

In this example, the first two lines do not fit a pattern, but the rest follows the pattern of an index variable being assigned a value and then a statement using the index variable.
{| border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%" align="left"
|-
|style="vertical-align:top" width="50%" |
```Python
i = 1
a = 13
i = 2
a = i*i
i = 3
a = i*i
i = 4
a = i*i
```
|style="vertical-align:top"|
```Python
i = 1
a = 13
for i = [2,3,4]
  a = i*i
```
|}

## General Pattern Example III

In this example, only the part after the first two lines fits the basic pattern and the repeated part takes up two lines.  That is, the statements
```Python
a = i*i
a = a+1
```
are repeated three times.

{| border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%" align="left"
|-
|style="vertical-align:top" width="50%" |
```Python
i = 1
a = 13
i = 2
a = i*i
a = a+1
i = 3
a = i*i
a = a+1
i = 4
a = a+1
a = i*i
```
|style="vertical-align:top"|
```Python
i = 1
a = 13
for i in [2,3,4]:
  a = i*i
  a = a+1
```
|}

## Populating a List

The index variable can be used to populate elements of a list:

```Python
A = [] # Declare A to be a list variable
for i in [0,1,2]:
  A.append(i*i) # Append result of i*i calc to end of A
print(A) # [0, 1, 4]
```

is the same as

```Python
A = [0*0, 1*1, 2*2]
print(A)
```

## Populating a List Examples

'''Problem:''' Create the list `A = [2,3,4,5]` and then display it

'''Answer:''' 

```Python
A = [] # Declare A to be a list variable
for i in [2,3,4,5]:
  A.append(i)
print(A)
```

'''Problem:''' Create the lists `A = [2,3,4,5]` and `B = [0,1,2,3]` and then display them.

'''Answer:''' 

In this problem, `A` and `B` each have four elements. We could create them using two `for` loops

```Python
A = []
for i in [2,3,4,5]:
  A.append(i)
print(A)
B = []
for i in [0,1,2,3]:
  B.append(i)
print(A)
print(B)
```

In general, code with fewer loops will run faster. So it is more efficient to use

```Python
A = []
B = []
for i in [0,1,2,3]:
  A.append(i+2)
  B.append(i)
print(A)
print(B)
```
 
'''Problem:''' Create the array `A = [5,4,3,2,1]` using `for i in [0,1,2,3,4]:`

'''Answer:''' 
```Python
A = []
for i in [0,1,2,3,4]:
  A.append(5-i)
print(A) # [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## The `range` function

The notation

```Python
for i in [0,1,2,3,4]:
```

is acceptable, but most often instead of specifying an list of values for the index variable, the `range` function is used. This is especially useful when the list would need to be very long.

Instead of writing:

```Python
for in [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]:
```

we can write:

```Python
for i in range(10)
```

which is read, "Start at 0 and increment in steps of 1. Stop at 10-1.".

The range function can be used to start counting at a number other than zero and can also be used to count in steps.

###  Stop Only

```Python
for i in range(stop): # Equiv. to for i in [0, 1, ..., stop-1]
```

For example,

```Python
for i in range(3): # range(3) -> [0, 1, 2]
  print("i =", i)
```

will print

```Python
i = 0
i = 1
i = 2
```

###  Start and Stop

```Python
for i in range(start, stop):
```

is equivalent to

```Python
for i in [start, start+1, start+2, ..., stop-1]:
```

For example,

```Python
for i in range(3, 6): # range(3, 6) -> [3, 4, 5]
  print("i =", i)
```

will print

```Python
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
```

###  Start, Stop, and Step

 ```Python
for i in range(start, stop, step):
# Equiv. to for i in [start, start+step, start+2*step, stop-1]:
```

is equivalent to

```Python
for i in [start, start+step, start+2*step, ..., stop-1]:
```

For example,

```Python
for i in range(3, 9, 2):
  print("i =", i)
```

will print

```Python
i = 3
i = 5
i = 7
```

`step` can be a negative number provided that `stop <= start`

```Python
for i in range(9, 0, -2):
  print("i =", i)
```

will print

```Python
i = 9
i = 7
i = 5
i = 3
i = 1
```

## Iteration using `while`

A second method of repeating commands involves the use of the `while` statement.  The loop executes as long as the test condition is true. The general syntax is

```Python
while test:
  Commands
```

In the following example, the commands `P=1.1*P` and `i = i+1` are repeated provided that `P` is less than 1000.  The last line of the program displays the last value of `P`.

```Python
i = 0
P = 100
while (P < 1000):
  P = 1.1*P;
  i = i+1;
print("Final value of P =", P)
print("Final value of i =", i)
```

## `break`

The `break` command can be used to terminate the execution of a `while` or `for` loop. In the following program, the value of `i` is checked before it is printed out. If `i > 10`, execution of the loop terminates. The result is the numbers 0, 1, ..., 10 are printed.

```Python
for i in range(100):
  if i > 10:
    break
  print(i)
print("Done with loop")
```

The result is that the following is displayed.

```Python
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Done with loop
```

## `continue`

The continue statement can be used to block the execution of code that follows it in the body of a `for` or `while` loop. For example

```Python
for i in range(20):
  if i < 10:
    continue # Don't execute following lines if i < 10
  print("i = ", i)
```

The result is that the following is displayed.

```Python
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
```

###  Computation using `for` loop

Write a `for` loop that computes the sum of the squares of all elements in an array.  For example, if the array is A = [1,2,3,4,5], the sum should be 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55.  Do not use the functions `sum` function or functions from external libraries (i.e., no `import` statements).

###  Computation using `for` loop

An object travels at a constant velocity of 10 m/s. Create a list named `x` that contains the position of the object at times \(t=0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 2.0\) seconds. Use a `for` loop for the computation of the elements of `x`. Assume the initial position is \(x=0\). When executed, your program should display the values of `t` and `x` in the form

<pre>
time position
0.0 0.0
0.1 1.1
0.2 2.2
...
2.0 22.0
</pre>

with the `...` replaced with values for `t=0.2` to `2.0`.

For more complex problems, it is often easier to write a solution without a for loop before attempting to write a solution using a for loop.

```Python
# Without a list or a for loop for first few steps
t = 0    # Initial time
x = 0.0  # Initial position
v = 11.0 # Object's velocity

    print('{0:.1f} {1:.1f}'.format(t,x[i]))
```

###  Computation using `for` loop

Your bank balance grows by an amount of 5% compounded on the last day of each year.  Your initial deposit is $100.  

Create a list named `b` that contains balance at the end of each year after compounding. Use a `for` loop for the computation of the elements of `b`. When executed, your program should display the year and balance.

<pre>
year balance
1    105.0
2    110.2
...
9    155.1
</pre>

with the `...` replaced with values for years 1-8.

For more complex problems, it is often easier to write a solution without a `for` loop before attempting to write a solution using a `for` loop.

```Python
# Without a list or a for loop for first 4 years
r = 0.05 # Interest rate
b = 100  # Initial account balance

print('year balance')
y = 1
b = b + b*0.05 # Balance at end of year 1 (after compounding)
print('{0}    {1:.1f}'.format(y, b))

y = 2
b = b + b*0.05 # Balance at end of year 2 (after compounding)
print('{0}    {1:.1f}'.format(y, b))

y = 3
b = b + b*0.05 # Balance at end of year 3 (after compounding)
print('{0}    {1:.1f}'.format(y, b))

y = 4
b = b + b*0.05 # Balance at end of year 4 (after compounding)
print('{0}    {1:.1f}'.format(y, b))
```

```Python
# With a list but no for loop for first 4 years

r = 0.05  # Interest rate
b = [100] # List of balances

print('year balance')

y = 1
b.append(b[y-1] + b[y-1]*r) # Append new balance to array
print('{0}    {1:.1f}'.format(y, b[y]))

y = 2
b.append(b[y-1] + b[y-1]*r) # Append new balance to array
print('{0}    {1:.1f}'.format(y, b[y]))

y = 3
b.append(b[y-1] + b[y-1]*r) # Append new balance to array
print('{0}    {1:.1f}'.format(y, b[y]))

y = 4
b.append(b[y-1] + b[y-1]*r) # Append new balance to array
print('{0}    {1:.1f}'.format(y, b[y]))
```

```Python
# With list and for loop
r = 0.05  # Interest rate
b = [100] # List of balances

print('year balance')
for y in range(1,11):
    b.append(b[y-1] + b[y-1]*r) # Append new balance to array
    print('{0}    {1:.1f}'.format(y, b[y]))

# Matplotlib

Matplotlib is the most commonly used Python plotting package. There are many other Python packages for plotting and many of them build on the basic functionality of Matplotlib (e.g., Seaborn and Bokeh).

## Importing Matplotlib

The start of any Python program where Matplotlib plot commands are used must start with

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

where the only optional part is `plt`, which declares the namespace of all Matplotlib methods.  All calls to Matplotlib plotting methods must be prefixed by `plt.`. (Sometimes authors will use `mpl` instead of `plt`.)

## Plotting List elements

In Python, line plots are created using the `plot` function prefixed by the module declared in the import command (here I am using `plt`).

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = [1 , 4, 16, 32] # Create list
plt.plot(y) # Plot list. x-values assumed to be [0, 1, 2, 3]
plt.show()  # Optional when using IPython interpreter
```

Note that if this script is called from the command line, no plot will be shown unless `show()` is called. Also note that when using the IPython interpreter, you can have the plots show up in a separate window by executing the command `%matplotlib qt`. To have the plots show up in the IPython console, enter `%matplotlib inline`. These are not regular Python commands - only IPython will understand them.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_I.py.png" width="500px"/>

The `plt.plot(y)` command caused a plot of the elements of `y` to be shown with the values in `y` on the y-axis.  The x-axis values were assumed to be `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.  The above commands are equivalent to 

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = [1, 4, 16, 32]
x = [0, 1, 2, 3]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_I.py.png" width="500px"/>

`plot` method.

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = [1, 4, 16, 32]
x = [10, 20 , 30, 40]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

## Annotation

To add a grid, use `grid()` after the plot command. To add axis labels and a title, use `xlabel`, `ylabel`, and `title`

```Python
import matplotlib.pylab as plt
y = [1, 4, 16, 32]
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.grid()
plt.xlabel('Time [seconds]');
plt.ylabel('Height [meters]');
plt.title('Experiment 1 results');
plt.show()
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_IV.py.png" width="500px"/>

Matplotlib labels can be specified using TeX strings (this may code may not work, most likely due to a needed package not being installed -- do a web search on the error message to figure out how to install the missing package). For example

```Python
# See above if this results in an error message.
import matplotlib.pylab as plt
y = [1, 4, 16, 32]
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.grid()
plt.xlabel('Time [seconds]');
plt.ylabel('Height [meters]');
plt.title(r'$\mathbf{A}=3\hat{\mathbf{x}} + 4\hat{\mathbf{y}}; E=mc^2$')
plt.show()
```

See [Matplotlib Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/tex_demo.html) for additional information.

## Line Color

A line color may be specified when calling the `plot` function. This set of commands will create a red line. Enter `help(plt.plot)` on the command line to see a table of all possible color abbreviations.

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = [1, 4, 16, 32]
plt.plot(y, 'r')       # Red line; 'g' would produce green line
plt.plot(y, color='r') # Same result using alternative syntax
plt.show()
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_V.py.png" width="500px"/>

Colors that do not have an associated abbreviation may be used by specifying a list of red, green, and blue intensity values. This set of commands will create a gray line.

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = [1, 4, 16, 32]
# 100% red intensity, 0% green, 0% blue
plt.plot(y, color=[1, 0, 0]) 
# Mixture of 50% red intensity, 50% green, and 50% blue
plt.plot(y, color=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]) 
plt.show()
```

To find a special color, I usually do a search on, e.g., "rgb values for periwinkle". Doing this, I find
`RGB: 204, 204, 255`, which is translated to intensity fractions by dividing each number by `255`, so I would use `color=[204/255, 204/255, 255/255]`.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_VI.py.png" width="500px"/>

## Line Style

By default, the points in `y` are connected with solid lines. Line styles options are
`solid`, `dashed`, `dashdot`, `dotted` or their corresponding short-hand strings of `-`, `:`, `-.`, `--` can also be used.

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = [1, 4, 16, 32]
plt.plot(y, '-', linewidth=5)
# or
plt.plot(y, linestyle='solid', linewidth=5) 
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_X.py.png" width="500px"/>

## Marker Style

Instead of drawing connected lines, markers can be drawn at points. See `help(plt.plot)` for a table of possible markers.

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = [1, 4, 16, 32];
plt.plot(y, '*') # Stars
#plt.plot(y, 'o') # Circles
plt.show()
```

<imgc>url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_VII.py.png|width=400px|expire=1</imgc>

Marker colors may be specified using the same syntax as the line color

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = [1, 4, 16, 32]
plt.plot(y, '*', color=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]) # Gray stars
plt.show()
```

<imgc>url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_VIII.py.png|width=400px|expire=1</imgc>

The marker size may be specified using `markersize` keyword

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = [1, 4, 16, 32]
plt.plot(y, '*', markersize=10)
plt.show()
```
|style="vertical-align:top"|
<imgc>url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_IX.py.png|width=400px|expire=1</imgc>

## Style Combinations

Multiple styles may be specified.  For example, to create a red solid line, use `r-`

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = [1, 4, 16, 32]
plt.plot(y, 'r-', linewidth=3)
```

<imgc>url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_XII.py.png|width=400px|expire=1</imgc>

To create a red solid line that connects points in `y` and to show stars at the points, use `r*-`

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = [1, 4, 16, 32]
plt.plot(y, 'r*-', linewidth=3, markersize=10)
# or (a bit easier to read)
plt.plot(y, color='r', linestyle='solid', 
         marker='*', linewidth=3, markersize=10)
```

<imgc>url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_XIII.py.png|width=400px|expire=1</imgc>

## Multiple lines and legends

To create a legend, use `legend`:

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
A = [1.0, 4.0, 16.0, 32.0]
B = [1.1, 4.4, 16.9, 32.9]
l1, = plt.plot(A, 'b')
l2, = plt.plot(B, 'r')
plt.legend(['A', 'B'])
plt.show()
```

<imgc>url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_XV.py.png|width=400px|expire=1</imgc>

To set the legend location, use the `loc` keyword. See `help(plt.legend)` or [https://matplotlib.org/users/legend_guide.html] for other options:

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
A = [1, 4, 16, 32]
B = [1.1, 4.4, 16.9, 32.9]
l1, = plt.plot(A, 'b')
l2, = plt.plot(B, 'r')
plt.legend(['A', 'B'], loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

<imgc>url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_XVI.py.png|width=400px|expire=1</imgc>

## Axis Tick Numbers

In the previous example, Matplotlib chose to label the values in 0.5 increments.  This is not a good default for the plotted list - all of the x-values are integers. Use `xticks` and `yticks` to specify the tick labels to show.

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
A = [1, 4, 16, 32]
plt.plot(A, 'r*-', linewidth=3, markersize=10)
plt.xticks([0,1,2,3])
plt.show()
```

To modify the y-position labels, use `yticks` instead of `xticks`.

<imgc>url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_XVII.py.png|width=400px|expire=1</imgc>

## Axis Limits

In the previous examples, only part of the first and last markers were shown. To expand the axis limits so the full markers are shown, use `plt.xlim()`

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
A = [1, 4, 16, 32]
plt.plot(A, 'r*-', linewidth=3, markersize=10)
plt.xticks([0, 1, 2, 3])
plt.xlim([-0.1, 3.1])
plt.show()
```

To modify the y-axis limits, use `ylim`.

<imgc>url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rweigel/computingforscientists/master/Plotting_1D/figures/Plotting_1D_XVIII.py.png|width=400px|expire=1</imgc>

## `imshow`

The following program demonstrates how a matrix can be plotted.

```Python
#from matplotlib import cm
import numpy as np

# Create matrix to plot
z = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
print(z)

# Open a new figure
plt.figure()

# Create a colormap with 4 colors from white to black.
cmap = plt.get_cmap('Greys', 4)

# Plot the matrix z
im = plt.imshow(z, cmap=cmap)

# Set labels
plt.xlabel('column')
plt.ylabel('row')

# Set x- an y-ticks to be integers
plt.gca().set_xticks([0, 1])
plt.gca().set_yticks([0, 1])

# Show colorbar
cb = plt.colorbar()

# Set colorbar axis label
#cb.set_label('z') # Next to colorbar axis numbers
cb.ax.set_title('z') # Top of colorbar

# Set colorbar limits so colors are centered on integers
plt.clim(-0.5, 3.5)

# Set colorbar ticks
#cb.set_ticks([0, 1])

# dpi=300 (dots per inch) saves a higher resolution image than the default
# bbox_inches='tight' removes extra whitespace surrounding plot
plt.savefig('HW11_3_imshow.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
```

# datetimes

If you get an error related to "utc datetime.timezone", remove `tzinfo=timezone.utc`. For example modify

```Python
t1 = datetime(1970, 1, 1, 
              hour=0, minute=0, second=0, 
              microsecond=0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
```

to be

```Python
 t1 = datetime(1970, 1, 1, 
              hour=0, minute=0, second=0, 
              microsecond=0)
```

A `datetime` object is used to store dates and times. The `datetime` object methods allow a given `datetime` to be manipulated.

The advantage of using `datetime`s is

1. One can do math on them, e.g., find the number of days, hours, minutes, seconds between two dates.
2. A time that is stored as a `datetime` can be easily rendered in different ways, e.g., "2019-01-01" or "2019-001".
3. When a list of `datetime`s is passed to Matplotlib's plot function, it will automatically use date labels on the axes.

## Basic Usage

In the following a datetime object `t1` is created using the `datetime` function. The name of the module is `datetime` and one of the functions is `datetime` and the type of an object created by the function `datetime` is ... `datetime`.

```Python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

# Basic method for creating a datetime object
# Everything after the day (third argument) is optional
t1 = datetime(1970, 1, 1, 
              hour=0, minute=0, second=0, 
              microsecond=0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)

# Number of seconds since 1970-01-01 UTC
# (called the "POSIX Epoch")
print(t1.timestamp()) # 0.0

# Print timestamp in ISO 8601 format. 
# The +00:00 is the time zone offset.
print(t1.isoformat()) # 1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

t1 = datetime(1970, 1, 1, 
              hour=0, minute=30, second=0, 
              microsecond=0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)

# Number of seconds since 1970-01-01 UTC
print(t1.timestamp()) # 1800.0
```

I recommend always specifying the timezone as UTC unless you are dealing with local times. When all timezones are not UTC, you may run into surprises when the differences between two `datetimes`s is computed. See [https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html].

## Creating Custom Time Strings

The `format` method used on strings has codes such as `d`, `f`, and `e` for representing a number as an integer, floating point number, or number in scientific notation. For example,

```Python
print("{0:f}".format(1.1)) # 1.100000
```

Similarly, the method `strftime` has specifiers for specifying how a date and time should be displayed. See [https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strftime] for a full list of specifiers.

```Python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

t1 = datetime(2019, 10, 23, 
              hour=1, minute=2, second=3, 
              microsecond=4, tzinfo=timezone.utc)

# Print timestamp using custom format
# See https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strftime
# for list of codes
print(t1.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')) # 2019-10-23
print(t1.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')) # 10/23/2019
print(t1.strftime('%Y-%j'))    # 2019-296 (%j = day of year)
print(t1.strftime('%Y-%m-%d @ %H:%M:%S.%f')) # 2019-10-23 @ 01:02:03.000004
```

## Time Deltas

A `timedelta` object represents the difference between two `datetime`s.

`timedelta` objects can be created using the `timedelta` function, e.g.,

```Python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

# Create a timedelta object
dt = timedelta(days=1, seconds=0, microseconds=0)

# Print information
print(dt.days)            # 1
print(dt.seconds)         # 0
print(dt.microseconds)    # 0
print(dt.total_seconds()) # 86400.0
```

`timedelta` objects can be computed using two `datetime` objects, e.g.,

```Python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

t1 = datetime(2019, 10, 23, 
            hour=0, minute=0, second=0, 
            microsecond=0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)

t2 = datetime(2020, 10, 23, 
			hour=0, minute=0, second=23, 
			microsecond=0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)

dt = t2 - t1

# Print information
print(dt.days)            # 366
print(dt.seconds)         # 23
print(dt.microseconds)    # 0
print(dt.total_seconds()) # 31622423.0
```

A `timedelta` can be added or subtracted from a `datetime`.

```Python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

# Create a base datetime
t1 = datetime(2019, 10, 23, 
			hour=0, minute=0, second=0, 
			microsecond=0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)

print(t1.isoformat()) # 2019-10-23T00:00:00+00:00

dt = timedelta(days=1, seconds=44, microseconds=0)

# Add an increment to base datetime
t2 = t1 + dt
print(t2.isoformat()) # 2019-10-24T00:00:44+00:00
```

## Creating a list of `datetimes`

Create a list with 10 datetime objects with a spacing of 1 day.

```Python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

t1 = datetime(2019, 10, 23, 
			hour=0, minute=0, second=0, 
			microsecond=0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)

# Create a list with 10 datetime objects with a spacing of 1 day
dt = timedelta(days=1)
T = []
for i in range(10):
    t = t1 + i*dt
    T.append(t)
    # Display what was appended in string format
    ts = t.isoformat()
    print(ts)
print(T)
'''

[datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 23, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc),
 datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 24, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc),
 datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 25, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc),
 datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 26, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc),
 datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 27, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc),
 datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 28, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc),
 datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 29, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc),
 datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 30, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc),
 datetime.datetime(2019, 10, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc),
 datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 1, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)]
'''
```

In the previous example, we used `range(10)`. A more likely use-case is that a start and stop `datetime` will be known, in which case the argument to `range` is better calculated from the difference between the start and stop `datetime`s.

```Python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

to = datetime(2015, 1, 12, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
tf = datetime(2015, 2, 13, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
dt_span = tf - to
dt = timedelta(days=1)
T = []
for i in range(dt_span.days):
    t = to + i*dt
    T.append(t)
    # Display what was added in string format
    ts = t.isoformat()
    print(ts)
"""

```

## Matplotlib and `datetimes`

Matplotlib will label any axis with `datetime` objects using a formatted string.

```Python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

to = datetime(2015, 1, 12, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
dt = timedelta(days=1)
T = []
y = []
for i in range(10):
    t = to + i*dt
    T.append(t)
    y.append(i)
    
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.plot(T, y, '.')
```

Matplotlib is often not good at choosing how to label a time axis. Typically one needs to search for examples of how to modify them, e.g., [https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/recipes/common_date_problems.html] or use a library that adds functionality to Matplotlib such as [Seaborn](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/recipes common_date_problems.html) or [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/).

## Parsing Custom Time Strings

Quite often, one will have a list of time strings that need to be converted into a `datetime` object. The `datetime` module does not know how to do this unless the string is in the standard ISO 8601 format. However, most date and time strings you will encounter are not in this standard format. (The Pandas library has a function that can guess the format.)

```Python
from datetime import datetime

# Date given in Year-DOY (DOY = day of year, aka "Julian Day")
# This is a common format in astronomy-related data
t1 = datetime.strptime('1999-004', '%Y-%j')
print(t1.isoformat()) # 1999-01-04T00:00:00

# String in standard US format
t1 = datetime.strptime('10/31/2019', '%m/%d/%Y')
print(t1.isoformat()) # 2019-10-31T00:00:00

# Same date as above but in format used in other parts of the world
t1 = datetime.strptime('31/10/2019', '%m/%d/%Y')
print(t1.isoformat()) # 2019-10-31T00:00:00
```

Convert a list of date and time strings to a list of `datetime` objects.

```Python
from datetime import datetime

T_strings = ['1999-001', '1999-002', '1999-003']
T_objects = []
for ts in T_strings:
    t = datetime.strptime(ts, '%Y-%j')
    T_objects.append(t)
    print(t.isoformat())
"""
1999-01-01T00:00:00
1999-01-02T00:00:00
1999-01-03T00:00:00
"""
```

# NumPy

See also [Numerical Python: Scientific Computing and Data Science Applications with Numpy, SciPy and Matplotlib](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Python-Scientific-Applications-Matplotlib/dp/1484242459)

## Importing

At the start of any program that uses NumPy, import it using `import numpy as np`, e.g., 

```Python
import numpy as np
print(np.pi) # Prefix Numpy usage with np
```

As with [Matplotlib's](#Matplotlib) import statement, the last string, in this case `np`, can vary

```Python
import numpy as npy # Sometimes npy used instead of np
print(npy.pi) # Prefix Numpy usage with npy
```

## Arrays

The general-purpose data structure in NumPy is the `ndarray` (as in N-dimensional array). It is an analog to the Python list. 

Whereas a list can contain values with different data types, a NumPy ndarray can only contain values with a single data type.

To review, a Python list can be created using the square bracket notation

```Python
L = [1, 2.1, 'zz'] # List with a mix of data types - int, float, and string
dir(L) # List all methods of L
```

The `dir` command lists all of the methods that apply to a list object such as `append`. (Ignore the ones that start with underscores for now.)

There are many ways to create a NumPy ndarray; the most basic uses the function `array` with an argument of a list.

```Python
import numpy as np
L = [1, 2, 3]
A = np.array(L) # Converts list L to a NumPy ndarray
type(A) # numpy.ndarray
dir(A) # List all methods of A
```

The list of methods and attributes displayed for the ndarray object `A` is much longer and contains mathematical operations such as `dot`, `min`, and `max`. Three of the key attributes that you will use are `shape`, `size`, and `dtype`:

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(A.shape) # (3, ) # Notation explained below
print(A.size)  # 3
print(A.dtype) # int64
```

A key restriction on a ndarray is that all elements are of the same data type. This is the reason that a ndarray can have a method `max` and `min` and why ndarrays can be multiplied and added. If a list contained strings and numbers, these operations are ill-defined.

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(L.max()) # Error b/c what is the max of 1, 2, and 'zz'?
# Error msg is "list object has no attribute 'max'".  

# This works as expected.
print(A.max()) # 3
```

## Array Shape

The shape of a ndarray is the number of rows and columns and additional dimensions. 

```Python
import numpy as np
M = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5]]) # Create ndarray from list of lists
print(M)
print(M.shape) # (2, 3) - two rows, three columns
```

The shape of NumPy ndarray is a tuple, not a list. Because tuples cannot be modified, this serves as a hint that an operation such as `s = M.shape; s[0] = 9` cannot be used to change the size of an array.

Going back to the first example, the trailing comma in the shape of `(3, )` needs to be explained.

```Python
A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(A)
print(A.shape) # (3, )
```

Based on the matrix example, where `M.shape = (2, 3)`, one may have expected `A.shape` to be `(3)` instead of `(3, )`. The short explanation is that the `(3, )` can generally be interpreted as meaning the same as `(3)` and the trailing comma can be ignored.

<details>
<summary>Long answer</summary>
The trailing comma is returned in the tuple for the shape of a 1-D array because 

1. a tuple with one element such as `(3)` is the same thing as `3` in Python and
2. code that uses NumPy is simpler if `A.shape` is always a tuple.

To see point 1., consider
```Python
t = (3)
print(type(t)) # int
print(t[0]) # Error
len(t) # Error

t = (3, )
print(type(t)) # tuple
print(t[0]) # 3
len(t) # 1
```

As a compromise, the unintuitive notation `(3, )` is used for the shape of 1-D NumPy arrays (and single-element tuples in general). The existence of the comma tells Python that the quantity in parenthesis is actually meant to be a tuple.

See also [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences].

The reason that the Python interpreter can't conclude `(3)` is a tuple is in math operations is it is acceptable to wrap a number in parenthesis and so I expect `(3)*1` to mean `3*1` and not a tuple times a scalar.
</details>

## Array Size

The size of an array is simply the number of elements. For example, a \(3\times 2\) array has \(3\cdot 2\) elements

```Python
import numpy as np
M = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5]])
print(M.size) # 6
```

The size of an array could also be computed from the product of the elements in the `shape` tuple:

```Python
import numpy as np
M = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5]])
N = M.size    # N = 6 
s = M.shape   # s = (3, 2)
N = s[0]*s[1] # N = 6

M = np.array([M, M]) # Create a 3-D array
N = M.size           # N = 12 
s = M.shape          # s = (3, 2, 2)
N = s[0]*s[1]*s[2]   # N = 12
```

## Array dtype

Every NumPy array has a data type attribute `dtype` that indicates how the numbers are stored internally. When the `np.array` function is used to convert a list to a NumPy array, the chosen dtype depends on the elements in the list.

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(A.dtype) # int32

A = np.array([1., 2., 3.])
print(A.dtype) # float64
```

The data type can be explicitly set using the `dtype` keyword.

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.float64)
print(A.dtype) # float64
```

There are many other possible `dtype`s -- see the [NumPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html). In general, using `np.float64` is the safest choice.

## Creating Arrays

See also [NumPy array creation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.array-creation.html).

The three most common functions for creating arrays are `zeros`, `ones`, and `zeros`.

`zeros` creates an array of a given size with all elements set to 0.

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.zeros((3,4)) # default is dtype=np.float64
# or
A = np.zeros((3,4), dtype=np.float64)
print(A)
#[[0. 0. 0. 0.]
# [0. 0. 0. 0.]
# [0. 0. 0. 0.]]
```

`ones` creates an array of a given size with all elements set to 1.

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.ones((3,4)) # default is dtype=np.float64
# or
# A = np.ones((3,4), dtype=np.float64)
print(A)
#[[1. 1. 1. 1.]
# [1. 1. 1. 1.]
# [1. 1. 1. 1.]]
```

`empty` creates an array of a given size with arbitrary values. The advantage of using this function is that it is faster than `ones` and `zeros` -- when an array is created using `zeros` or `ones`, the program needs to do two things (1) find memory to store the array values and (2) set all of the values. With `empty`, step (2) is skipped and the values that appear depend on what was located in the allocated memory slots previously.

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.empty((3, 4)) # default is dtype=np.float64
# or
# A = np.empty((3, 4), dtype=np.float64)
print(A) # Ouptut will vary
```

## Initializing Arrays

### With NaNs

Arrays can be initialized with values other than zero and one. Probably the safest approach is to start with an `ndarray` of all NaN (Not-a-Number) values:

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.full((3, ), np.nan) 
print(A)
# [nan nan nan]
```

The motivation for initialization with NaNs is that coding errors become more obvious. The following program intends to set a value to each element in an array and then print the sum, but there is an error so that the last value is never set. When executed, the sum `nan` is printed:

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.full((4, ), np.nan)
for i in range(len(A)-1): # Error is that this should be len(A)
    A[i] = i
print(np.sum(A)) # nan - you know something went wrong
```

In contrast, if the values of `A` were initialized to zero, this coding error may not have been noticed:

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.zeros((4, ))
for i in range(len(A)-1): # Error is that this should be len(A)
    A[i] = i
print(np.sum(A)) # 3, but should be 7
```

There are [other initialization methods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1704823/initializing-numpy-matrix-to-something-other-than-zero-or-one) that should be considered if execution speed is a concern, e.g.,

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.empty((3, )) # Multiply each element by NaN.
A[:] = numpy.nan # Set each element to NaN
# or
# A = np.full((3, ), np.nan)
# or
# A = np.empty((3, )) 
# A.fill(numpy.nan)
```

See also [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1704823/create-numpy-matrix-filled-with-nans).

###  With Equally Spaced Values

The functions [`arange`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html) and [`linspace`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html) are both used to create an 1-D `ndarray` with equally spaced values. 

Either of the two functions can be used to create arrays with equally spaced values, but the NumPy documentation recommends that
* `arange` should only be used to create an ndarray with integer values, e.g., `[1., 2., 3.]`
* `linspace` should be used to create an ndarray with non-integer values, e.g., `[0.1, 0.2, 0.]`

Important:
* stop values are exclusive for arange (last value is stop-1)
* stop values are inclusive for linspace (last value is stop)

`arange`

1. `arange(stop)` Gives `[0, 1, ..., stop-1]`
2. `arange(start, stop)` Gives `[start, start+1, ..., stop-1]`. `stop > start` is required to give non-empty result
3. `arange(start, stop, step)` When `step` is given, `start` and/or `stop` can be negative, as can `step`.

```Python
print(np.arange(5))        # [0 1 2 3 4]

print(np.arange(2, 5))     # [2 3 4]
print(np.arange(-2, 3))    # [-2 -1 0 1 2]
print(np.arange(-5, -1))   # [-5 -4 -3 -2]

print(np.arange(1, 6, 2))    # [1 3 5]
print(np.arange(6, 1, -2))   # [6 4 2]
print(np.arange(0, -10, -2)) # [6 4 2]
print(np.arange(-6, -9, -1)) # [-6 -7 -8]
```

`linspace`
1. `linspace(start, stop)` Gives 50 equally spaced values with a first value of `start` and last value of `stop`.
2. `linspace(start, stop, num)` Gives `num` equally spaced values with a first value of `start` and last value of `stop`.

```Python
print(np.linspace(0, 1, 5))  # [0. 0.25 0.5  0.75 1.]
print(0.25*np.arange(0, 5))  # [0. 0.25 0.5  0.75 1.]

print(np.linspace(0, 5, 5))  # [0. 1.25 2.5 3.75 5.]

print(np.linspace(0, 5, 6))  # [0. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.]

print(np.linspace(0, -5, 6)) # [0. -1. -2. -3. -4. -5.]
```

**Example**

```Python
# Create B = [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5] using a for loop
B = np.zeros(6)
for i in range(len(B)):
    B[i] = i/10
print(B)

# Create B = [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5] using linspace and arange
B = 0.1*np.linspace(0, 5, 6)
# or
B = np.linspace(0, 0.5, 6)
# or
B = 0.1*np.arange(0, 6)
```

###  With Random Numbers

See also [NumPy random documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/routines.random.html).

Sometimes one wants to use an array in which its values are based on a draw from a statistical distribution, such as a uniform or Gaussian ("normal") distribution.

#### Gaussian ("Normal")

`randn` and `random.normal`

To create a 100-element array with numbers drawn by selecting a random floating point value from a Gaussian ("normal") distribution with a mean of 1.0 and standard deviation of 1.0, use `randn`:

```Python
A = np.random.randn(100)
print(np.mean(A)) # Should be close to 0.0
print(np.std(A)) # Should be close to 1.0
```

More generally, use `np.random.normal(mean, std, size=N)` to generate an array of size `N` with values drawn from a Gaussian with mean of `mean` and standard deviation of `std`.

```Python
mu = 100
std = 10
n = 200
np.random.normal(mu, std, size=n)
```

Multidimensional arrays can also be created

```Python
A = np.random.randn(3, 4)
print(A.shape) # (3, 4)
```

#### Uniform

`rand` and `randint`

To create a 100-element array with numbers drawn by selecting a random floating point in the half-open interval [0, 1.0), use `rand`:

```Python
A = np.random.rand(100)
print(np.mean(A)) # Should be close to 0.5
```

`randint`
 
To create a 100-element array with numbers drawn by randomly selecting an integer in a specified range, use `randint`.

```Python
A = np.random.randint(0, 101, (100, )) # Possible values are 0, 1, ..., 1000
print(np.mean(A)) # Should be close to 50.0
```

Multidimensional arrays can also be created

```Python
A = np.random.rand(3, 4)
print(A.shape) # (3, 4)

A = np.random.randint(0, 101, (3, 4))
print(A.shape) # (3, 4)
```

The way in which the shape of the array is specified for `randint` differs from `rand` and `randn`. The following all create a $M\times N\times L$ array with random numbers

```Python
M = 3
N = 4
L = 5
A = np.random.rand(M, N, L)
A = np.random.randn(M, N, L)
A = np.random.randint(0, 101, (M, N, L))
```

In the case of `randint`, the shape of the desired array is specified using a tuple.

## Accessing Elements

TODO: Cover indexing vs. slicing.

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([11,12,13])
x = A[[0,1]] # x is new array
y = A[0:2]   # y is reference to elements 0 and 1 of x

x[0] = 99
print(A)    # [11 12 13]
y[0] = 99
print(A)    # [99 12 13]
```

### 1-D

For 1-D NumPy `ndarray`s, the syntax is similar to that for lists

```Python
import numpy as np
A = [11,12,13]
x = np.array(A)

print(A[0])
# 11
print(x[0])
# 11

print(A[0:2])
# [11, 12]
print(x[0:2])
# [11 12]
```

### 2-D

For 2-D and higher dimensions, NumPy uses a different syntax than that used for Python lists. To access element `i, j` of a NumPy `ndarray` `A`, use `A[i, j]`. This syntax will not work for a 2-D list.

```Python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2-D NumPy ndarray
x = np.array([[11,12,13],[14,15,16]])
print(x)
#[[11 12 13]
# [14 15 16]]
print(x.shape) # (2, 3)

print(x[0,0]) # row 0, col 0
# 11

print(x[0,1]) # row 0, col 1
# 12

x[0,1] = 99
print(x)
#[[11 99 13]
# [14 15 16]]
```

A common programming pattern is to iterate over each element in a matrix and print out its value.

```Python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([[11,12,13],[14,15,16]])
print(x)
#[[11 12 13]
# [14 15 16]]

print('i j x[i,j]') # print header
# x.shape = (2, 3), so
# x.shape[0] = 2
# x.shape[1] = 3
for i in range(x.shape[0]): # iterate over rows
    for j in range(x.shape[1]): # iterate over columns
        print("{0:d} {1:d} {2:d}".format(i, j, x[i,j]))
print(x)

# i j x[i,j]
# 0 0 11
# 0 1 99
# 0 2 13
# 1 0 14
# 1 1 15
# 1 2 16
```

## Modifying Elements

### 1-D

#### With Loop

The syntax for modifying a 1-D NumPy `ndarray`s is similar to that was used for lists:

```Python
import numpy as np
t = np.zeros(5)
for i in range(5):
    t[i] = i
print(t) # [0. 1. 2. 3. 4.]
```

The above can be compared with the method that would be used to create and modify `t` using lists.

```Python
# Create a list
t = []
for i in range(5):
    t.append(0)
print(t)
# [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Modify an existing list
for i in range(5):
    t[i] = i
print(t)
# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### Without Loop

```
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], dtype=np.float)

a[0:3] = 99 # Set value of elements 0, 1, 2 to 99
print(a)    # [99. 99. 99.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9. 10.]

a[ a >= 99 ] = np.nan # Replace 99s with np.nan

print(a)    # [nan nan nan  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9. 10.]

print(np.nansum(a))
```

### 2-D

```
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], dtype=np.float)

print(A.size)   # 6
print(A.shape)  # (2, 3)

A[0,1:3] = 99   # Set values in row 0, columns 1 and 2 to 99

print(A)

# [[ 1. 99. 99.]
# [ 4.  5.  6.]]
```

## Finding Elements

An example of finding elements is

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
idx = A < 3
print(idx)      # [True True False False False]
B = A[idx]
print(B)        # [1 2]
```

If only the number of elements in `A` that match the constraint is desired, any of the following can be used

```Python
N = np.sum(idx)             # True is treated as 1, False as 0
N = len(idx[idx == True])
N = len(B)
```

The above is equivalent to the following

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
idx = np.empty(np.shape(A), dtype=np.bool)
B = []
for i in range(A.size):
    if A[i] < 3:
        B.append(A[i])
        idx[i] = True
    else:
        idx[i] = False

B = np.array(B)

print(idx)      # [True True False False False]
print(B)        # [1 2]
print(len(B))   # 2
```

Alternatively, [`np.where`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.where.html) can be used. The syntax is


`np.where(` _`condition`_, _`value if condition true`_, _`value if condition false`_)


The problem solved earlier using [`np.where`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.where.html) is

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
B = np.where( A < 3, 1, 0)
# In locations where A  < 3, B will have the value of 1
# In locations where A >= 3, B will have the value of 0
print(B)        # [1,1,0,0,0]
print(sum(B))   # 2
```

Compound conditions can be evaluated using [`np.logical_and()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.logical_and.html). For example, to find elements in `A` in the range `[2,4]`

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
B = np.where(np.logical_and( A >= 2, A <= 4), 1, 0)
print(B) # [0 1 1 1 0]
```

To return the indices, use [`np.nonzero()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.nonzero.html), e.g.,

```Python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
B = np.asarray( A > 2).nonzero()[0]
print(B) # array([2, 3, 4])
```

## Histograms

See also [Matplotlib's documentation on the histogram function](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html)

The syntax for the histogram function in Matplotlib is demonstrated in this example.

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

mu = 80.
sigma = 7.
n = 2000
x = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, size=n)


# Default; Should almost never use. Default bin choices are usually poor.
plt.hist(x)

# Expected peak is at 80. Create bins with edges at 45, 47, ..., 113
# so that centers are at 46, 48, ..., 80, ..., 112
plt.figure()
bins = np.arange(45,115,2)
print(bins)
plt.grid(axis='y')
plt.hist(x, bins=bins)
plt.title('$\mu= %.2f$, $n=%d$, $\overline{X} = $ %.2f' % (mu, n, np.mean(x)))
plt.xlabel('$X$')
plt.ylabel('# in bin')
```
