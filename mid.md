Title: Spring 2025 PHYS/ASTR 390/590 Midterm Exam
```

Write your answers on the provided paper and put your name on each sheet. You have the entire class period to work on the exam.

# 

1. Provide a visual derivation of $P(B|A)=P(A|B)P(B)/P(A)$

2. One bag contains only white balls, while another bag contains 30 white balls and 10 black balls. A bag is selected at random, and a ball from that bag is selected at random. The selected ball is white. What is the probability that the selected ball was from the bag with only white balls?

# 

Derive the Gaussian distribution from the Binomial distribution.

#

Explain the interpretation of 

1. a confidence interval,
2. not rejecting a null hypothesis, and
3. a $P$ value.

Provide examples to support your explanation, if needed.

#

1. You are given a list of $100$ numbers and asked to compute a 95% confidence interval on their average. Describe how you would calculate the confidence interval using the non--parametric bootstrap. Provide enough details so that your description can be implemented in code without ambiguity.

2. Describe how you would use a parametric simulation to determine if a sample statistic is biased.
